The figture of my assignment works well: when player drag the words into proper place(which in the words box), the word will be test and recorded on the "word" display, then by player dragging following words, the full words will be test through dictionary whether it is the right or not, if it's right word, the game will allow player continue next roll of game and credit the score of that term; otherwise, it will block at that term until player fix it or start again. After finish one game, the high-score board will post the highest score on records to let players compete.
